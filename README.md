# Tensor Decomposition Tutorial
Code of the Tensor Decomposition Tutorial

## Description
This repository contains the very minimal example we will use to show
how to decompose tensors using
[TensorLy](http://tensorly.org/stable/index.html) and
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## Installation
To run the example, download either Conda, Miniconda or Miniforge.
Then, just recreate the environment!

## CUDA Support
I am assuming that you have a working Nvidia GPU to use CUDA.
